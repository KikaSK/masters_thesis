# Master's thesis
Triangulation of regular implicit surfaces.

## Installation of the dependencies

Algorithm is implemented in C++.

### Linux
```
$ sudo apt-get install libginac-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev // if you want to run tests
```

### Windows

Firstly, you need to install `GiNaC` library. You can find installation instructions
[HERE](https://www.ginac.de/Download.html). Before downloading GiNaC you'll need to install 
[CLN](https://www.ginac.de/CLN/), which is also explained in GiNaC installation guide.

## Downloading and running the code on Linux OS

You can find the algorithm on [Github](https://github.com/KikaSK/masters_thesis). To clone the repositary:

1. Open the terminal in the folder where you want to clone the repository.
2. Paste the following commands to the terminal:
    - `git clone https://github.com/KikaSK/masters_thesis`
    - `cd masters_thesis`
    - `make`
